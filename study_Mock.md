* Mock - Mocking and Testing Library
> mock is now part of the Python standard library, available as *unittest.mock* in Python 3.3 onwards.
Mock is very easy to use and is designed for use with unittest. Mock is based on the ‘action -> assertion’ pattern instead of ‘record -> replay’ used by many mocking frameworks.
