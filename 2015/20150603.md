# md5 in Python
* inefficient way:
`
hashlib.md5(file.read()).hexdigest()
`
* Pythonic
`
import hashlib
def md5_for_file(path, block_size=256*128, hex=True):
    '''
    Block size directly depends on the block size of your filesystem
    to avoid performances issues
    Here I have blocks of 4096 octets (Default NTFS)
    '''
    md5 = hashlib.md5()
    with open(path,'rb') as f: 
        for chunk in iter(lambda: f.read(block_size), b''): 
             md5.update(chunk)
    return md5.hexdigest() if hex else md5.digest()

>  Python: os.path.getctime() does not refer to creation time on *nix systems, but rather the last time the inode data changed. 

> os.stat returns a tagged-tuple with st_mtime and st_ctime attributes. The modification time is st_mtime on both platforms; unfortunately, on Windows, ctime means "creation time", whereas on POSIX it means "change time". I'm not aware of any way to get the creation time on POSIX platforms.

> In general, UNIX filesystems do not store creation time at all -- there's no method for retrieving data that was never written to disk in the first place.

* [ctime does not mean creation time on POSIX systems][1]
