# Things about object in python

method wrapper??

### dictproxy

In Python attributes are implemented using a dictionary 
>>> class C(object): pass
>>> c = C()
>>> c.__dict__['a'] = 'a'
>>> c.a
a

But for "object", it uses a 'dictproxy' as an interface to prevent such assignement. You can't modify the metaclass Type directly neither.
Python's internals take great care to make built-in types IMMUTABLE -- very different design choices from Ruby's. It's impossible to make object "monkeypatchable" without deeply messing with the C-coded internals and recompiling the Python runtime to make a very different version (this is for the classic CPython, but I believe exactly the same principle holds for other implementations such as Jython and IronPython, just s/C/Java/ and S/C/C#/ respectively
`metaclasses` will only affect classes and objects that use them, not existing built-in types such as object, int, str, float, and so on. So, "all objects" is just not going to happen. (You can stick new functions into builtin of course, which will make them just as widely available, but they're not going to be METHODS of the object built-in type.


>>> C.__dict__

 '__doc__': None,
 '__module__': '__main__',
 '__weakref__': <attribute '__weakref__' of 'C' objects>}>
>>> C.__dict__['a'] = 1
